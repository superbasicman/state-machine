 i just created a project and ran it and it did not auto decide. 

 heres what i ran to create it: 
 node bin/cli.js --setup demo -t project-builder 
 
 and heres what i ran to run it:
 node bin/cli.js run demo -l

 it looks like maybe scope-clarifier auto decided. but lets make sure all agents decide for us. lets also update so we decide like this: if project ran with -a flag, then we see a log at the start of the run in the cli that says workflow is in full auto mode or something. also when an interaction is needed we should keep the same behavior that we have when full auto mode is not active. but in the cli and remote follow we should show agent deciding for you in N seconds. the default should be 3 seconds. but it can be configured in workflows/<workflow-name>/config.js

 heres the logs in history.jsonl:
